# app-academy-open
~~notes and code from the bootcamp~~ discontinued my progress as the free curriculum has missing important projects that's in the paid curriculum, lacks learner support and assignment assessment (literally none), heavy focus on javascript syntax, among other things. it's basically a demo to their paid curriculum.

i made the the realization that "free" things always come with strings attached despite what some paid individuals have you believe, either by wasting your time or eventually asking for money. i value time more than anything and app academy open wasted mine so i highly recommend you stay away.
