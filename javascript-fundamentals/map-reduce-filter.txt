Advanced array looping functions include:

Array.forEach()
Given an array, forEach iterates through the contents and does stuff with it based on what is specified in the brackets. Often you can just create a function inside.

Array.map()
Does something similar to forEach where it does stuff with an array, but map expects a return value from the function it is working with, while forEach does not.

Array.filter()
filter allows to make the code more concise by replacing for loop and an if statement in the case you want to filter an output from the array.

Array.reduce(<callback function>, initialValue)
reduce can be used to reduce the elements of an array to a single element, whether it's through summing all numbers in the array, or choosing the longest word in a sentence, etc.
