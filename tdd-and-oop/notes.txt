OOP was like the industrial revolution, according to steve jobs.

OOP makes things scalable, organized, and modular.

reminder of polya's problem solving framework:
1. understand the problem.
2. come up with a plan.
3. execute the plan.
4. revisit and refactor your solution.

Encapsulation: hiding the complexity of an object. using that object without knowing how it works.

a public object can be accessed by other objects.

a private object can only be accessed by its own object.

a class is a framework (a blueprint) that specifies an object with properties and methods.

properties (data) // methods (actions).

a class is just a framework until it is instantiated. instantiated similar to how a function is just a function framework until it is called.

an object made from a class is called an instance.

the device used to read the article i am taking notes of is an instance of the class Computer.

when a class is instantiated, properties and methods need to be set right away. a special method called a constructor handles that for us.
